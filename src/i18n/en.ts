      title: 'What tech stack do generated apps use?',
      description:
        'All apps are built with React 19, TypeScript, Vite, Tailwind CSS, and shadcn/ui components. The stack is modern, well-documented, and widely adopted — so if you want to extend or customize the code yourself, you can.',

    q4: {
      title: 'Can I export and own the code?',
      description:
        'Yes. Every app you build belongs to you. Export the full source code to GitHub at any time, or download it as a ZIP. There are no platform fees on the code itself — it is yours to deploy anywhere.',

    q5: {
      title: 'How secure is Borchani?',
      description:
        'We take security seriously. API keys are encrypted end-to-end, code runs in isolated containers that are torn down after each session, and our infrastructure is built on SOC 2-ready cloud services. We never store your API keys in plaintext.',

      title: 'What happens if the AI makes a mistake?',
